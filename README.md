Hangman Game

This is a simple command line hangman game written in Python.

How to Play
  
When you run the program, 
  
It will first prompt you to select a topic category: fruits, animals, programs, veggies, soft drinks, or electronics.

It will then randomly select a word from the list for that category.

You will see the blank underscores representing each letter of the word.

Your goal is to guess the letters one at a time to reveal the full word before you run out of lives.

You have 6 lives. Each wrong guess will lose a life.

If you lose all 6 lives, you lose the game. If you reveal the full word before losing all lives, you win!

After each game ends, it will ask if you want to play again.
